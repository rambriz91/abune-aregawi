        Worship Services are held every Saturday Morning from 5:30 AM until
        Noon. After Worship, we enjoy our Community Hour. Here, we gather to
        connect with our guests, friends and families over traditional Ethiopian
        food dishes brought by our families. We celebrate the customary holidays
        on our traditional calendar, including Christmas, Good Friday, Easter,
        St Abune's birthday, the anniversary of St. Abunes establishment of the
        temple, etc.
