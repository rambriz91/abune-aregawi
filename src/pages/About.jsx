      <p className='m-10'>
        YOU are invited to join us! We are a small, dynamic, conservative
        congregation, centrally located in San Diego, CA. Family, culture and
        congregation are three pillars of who we are. Many of our congregants
        are fluent in Amharic and Tigre, learning English to communicate with
        and honor our local neighbors. We particularly welcome immigrants so we
        may help integrate them into our wonderful San Diego Community. Please
        join us at any of our weekly services. Send us an email and we will
        assign an Ambassador to welcome you and introduce you to your new Church
        Family!
